### Projects

**Team Projects**
1. Web Application Development (2020/01~2020/04, Team of six members)
    > Having an partnership with MEG, developed a web application using Python Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, React, JavaScript as a memeber of developing team. Mainly worked on DB and Backend. It was a searching engine for ethical produts. [Github](https://github.com/SmitRao/meg)
2. UI/UX Design (2019/09~2019/12, Team of six members)
    > Following through the diamond iterative design process (Design, Prototype, Evaluate(including usability testing and expert reviews)), I designed a mobile application. Main feature of this application is managing one's yearly/monthly/daily plan and motivating users to stick their goals.

**Personal Projects (2020)**
1. `NLP/NN/DL` Learning Distributed Word Representations
    > Implemented gradient update of GloVe and find out relationship between dimensionality and its validation performance. Studied the neural language model (Bengio et al. [2003]) and compared it with the n-gram model by visualizing with t-SNE vectors(Maaten and Hinton [2008]). Trained the neural language model and analyzed its performance.

2. [Vision/NN/DL] CNN: Colourization and Classification, UNet. Fine-tune Semenatic Segmentation Model.
    > Trained CNN for image colourization using CIFAR-10 data set; given greyscale image, predicted the color at each pixel. Implemented convolution layer. Implemented UNet (Ronneberger et al. [2015]) and compared its performance with that of CNN. Using deeplav3(Chen et al. [2017]) pre-trained model and fine-tuned its last layer(freezing other parts) on Oxford17 (Nilsback and Zisserman [2008]) flower dataset. 

3. [NLP/NN/DL] Attention-Based Neural Machine Translation: Translation between PigLatin(toy language) and English using GRU, Additive Attention, Scaled Dot Product Attention(Causal / Non-causal) models
    > Implemented attention based NMT models. Analyzed performance of three different models: traditional encoder-decoder model(using GRU), additive attention decoder model, transformer model.

4. [NLP/NN/DL] BERT fine-tuning
    > Fine-tuned BERT pretrained model on the single sentence classification task using verbal arithmetic dataset. Improved performance by hyperparameter tuning (applied weight decay in optimizer).

**Personal Projects (2019)**
1. [NLP/Computational Linguistics] Dependency Parsing
    > Transition-Based Dependency Parsing, Neural Dependency Parser [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/DependencyParser)
    
2. [NLP/Computational Linguistics] Context-Free Grammar Parsing(Auxiliary system, Subcategorization related) [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/CFG)
3. [NLP/Computational Linguistics] Feature Grammar Parsing (Verb complements) [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/featureGrammar)
4. [AI] Pacman Game ([Searching](https://github.com/limhyesu98/pacman_search), [Multi-Agent](https://github.com/limhyesu98/pacman_multiagent), [Exact/Approximate Inference](https://github.com/limhyesu98/pacman_tracking))
5. [AI] Constraint Satisfaction Problems - NQueens, Sudoku [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/csp)
6. [DB] MariaDB(RDBMS), MySQL 을 이용한 웹 애플리케이션 개발. 데이터베이스 중심. [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/COSE371_DB)
7. [Data Science]: Recommendation Model: user-based collaborative filtering model [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/COSE471_DataScience)

**개인 프로젝트 (2018)**
1. [NLP/NN/DL] 기계학습 기법을 이용한 오픈소스 기반 문서 요약 시스템에 관한 연구 (KU 학부연구생 4기): Seq-to-seq Attention Model 을 사용한 abstractive summarization model [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/myTextSum)
2. [NLP/NN/DL] Extract topmost sentences / short summary from the article: Extraction based summarization [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/study_AutomaticSummarization)
