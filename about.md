### Projects

**Team Projects**
1. Web Application Development (2020/01~2020/04, Team of six members)
    > Having an partnership with MEG, developed a web application using Python Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, React, JavaScript as a memeber of developing team. Mainly worked on DB and Backend. It was a searching engine for ethical produts. [Github](https://github.com/SmitRao/meg)
2. UI/UX Design (2019/09~2019/12, Team of six members)
    > Following through the Double Diamond iterative design process (Design, Prototype, Evaluate(including usability testing and expert reviews)), I designed a mobile application. Main features of this application are managing one's yearly/monthly/daily plan and motivating users to stick their goals.

**Personal Projects (2020)**
1. `NLP/NN/DL` Learning Distributed Word Representations
    > Implemented gradient update of GloVe and find out relationship between dimensionality and its validation performance. Studied the neural language model (*Bengio et al., 2003*) and compared it with the n-gram model by visualizing with t-SNE vectors(*Maaten and Hinton, 2008*). Trained the neural language model and analyzed its performance. [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/CSC413_NN-DL/tree/master/PA1)

2. `Vision/NN/DL` CNN: Colourization and Classification, UNet. Fine-tune Semenatic Segmentation Model.
    > Trained CNN for image colourization using CIFAR-10 data set; given greyscale image, predicted the color at each pixel. Implemented convolution layer. Implemented UNet (*Ronneberger et al., 2015*) and compared its performance with that of CNN. Using deeplav3(*Chen et al., 2017*) pre-trained model and fine-tuned its last layer(freezing other parts) on Oxford17 (*Nilsback and Zisserman, 2008*) flower dataset. [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/CSC413_NN-DL/tree/master/PA2)

3. `NLP/NN/DL` Attention-Based Neural Machine Translation
    > Implemented attention based Neural Machine Translation models.(Transition between PigLatin(toy language) and English) Analyzed performance of three different models: traditional encoder-decoder model(using GRU), additive attention decoder model, transformer model(*Vaswani et al., 2017*). [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/CSC413_NN-DL/tree/master/PA3)

4. `NLP/NN/DL` BERT fine-tuning
    > Fine-tuned BERT pretrained model on the single sentence classification task using verbal arithmetic dataset. Improved performance by hyperparameter tuning (applied weight decay in optimizer). [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/CSC413_NN-DL/tree/master/PA3)

^ Planning to upload the code of these projects at the end of this term.

**Personal Projects (2019)**
1. `NLP/Computational Linguistics` Dependency Parsing
    > Implemented Transition-Based Dependency Parsing, Neural Dependency Parser [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/DependencyParser)
    
2. `NLP/Computational Linguistics` Context-Free Grammar Parsing
    > Developed and anlyzed limitations of context free grammar for the chart parser in NLTK focusing on Auxiliary system and Subcategorization related. [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/CFG)

3. `NLP/Computational Linguistics` Feature Grammar Parsing
    > Dveloped feature grammar using TRALE system(*Meurers, Penn and Richter, 2002; Penn, 2004*) focusing on Verb complements. [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/featureGrammar)

4. `AI` Pacman Game ([Searching](https://github.com/limhyesu98/pacman_search), [Multi-Agent](https://github.com/limhyesu98/pacman_multiagent), [Exact/Approximate Inference](https://github.com/limhyesu98/pacman_tracking))
5. `AI` Constraint Satisfaction Problems - NQueens, Sudoku [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/csp)
6. `DB` Web Application Development
    > Developed a web application about managing one's portfolio using MariaDB and MySQL. Mainly worked on DB. [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/COSE371_DB)
7. `Data Science` Recommendation Model
    > Explored and analyzed Black Friday Dataset from Kaggle and built a recommendation model using user-based collaborative filtering model. [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/COSE471_DataScience)

**Personal Projects (2018)**
1. `NLP/NN/DL` 기계학습 기법을 이용한 오픈소스 기반 문서 요약 시스템에 관한 연구 (KU 학부연구생 4기)
    > Did a research about abstractive summarization model using Seq-to-seq Attention Model. [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/myTextSum)
2. `NLP/NN/DL` Extract topmost sentences / short summary from the article: Extraction based summarization [Github](https://github.com/limhyesu98/study_AutomaticSummarization)
