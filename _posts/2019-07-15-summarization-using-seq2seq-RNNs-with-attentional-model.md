title : Summarizations using Seqeunce-to-sequnece RNNs with attentional model
---

This post is review of the [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K16-1028)
*Abstractive Text Summarization using Sequence-to-sequence RNNs and Beyond*.




This paper is about modeling abstractive text summarization usign Attentional Encoder Decoder Recurrent Neural Networks.
It was pubslished at Aug 7, 2016 by Nallapati et al.<br>

I am going to focus on the model and the result of summarization in this post.
