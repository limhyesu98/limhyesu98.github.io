title : Summarizations using Seqeunce-to-sequnece RNNs with attentional model
---

This post is a review of the [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K16-1028)
*Abstractive Text Summarization using Sequence-to-sequence RNNs and Beyond*.




This paper is about modeling abstractive text summarization using Attentional Encoder Decoder Recurrent Neural Networks.
It was pubslished at Aug 7, 2016 by Nallapati et al.<br>

I have taken part in KU undergraduate researcher program at 2018 related to this paper.
The project was about reviewing this paper and running the Textsum code by myself. You can see the final report [here](https://github.com/limhyesu98/myTextSum/blob/master/%EC%B5%9C%EC%A2%85%20%EA%B2%B0%EA%B3%BC%20%EB%B3%B4%EA%B3%A0%EC%84%9C_%EC%9E%84%ED%98%9C%EC%88%98.pdf).
