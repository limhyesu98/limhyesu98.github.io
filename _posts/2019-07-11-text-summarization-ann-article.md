title : Finding Top n Important Senteces from Article
---

In this post, we find top n important sentences from articles. 




From raw articles such as Wikipedia, we clean the raw data. Then using the frequency of words, we conclude that
 the most frequent word is the most important word. Based on this idea, we choose n important sentences.<br>
You can see the detail code [here](https://github.com/limhyesu98/study_AutomaticSummarization/blob/master/ANN%20article%20data.ipynb).
