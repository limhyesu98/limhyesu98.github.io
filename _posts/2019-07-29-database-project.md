### 2019 Database Term Project





#### Project title : Website based on database that can manage personal portfolio
In this project, I made an website about personal portfolio. You can see the site [here](http://115.68.231.165/~2017320160/portfolio).
Through this website, you can add, modify, delete, see the list, and search for daily plan, course outcome, noncourse outcome, and cover letter that you have written.<br>

ERD(Entity-Relationship-Diagram) for this database is as below.

I used MariaDB for DBMS and mySQL. Detail explanation of this project is in this [report](https://github.com/limhyesu98/COSE371_DB/blob/master/Term_Report_1st.pdf),
and the codes are [here](https://github.com/limhyesu98/COSE371_DB/tree/master/portfolio).<br>

This was term project from Database lecture COSE371 from Korea University.
