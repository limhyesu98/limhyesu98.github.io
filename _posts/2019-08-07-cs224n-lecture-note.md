title : Lecture Summary of CS224N
---

This post is about lecture note I wrote after taking CS224N on-line course from Stnaford University.



CS224n course is a course named 'Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning' the detail explanation is written [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/index.html).
I could take the on-line course via [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6).
Taking this course, I made my own lecture note written in Korean. You can see the document [here](https://github.com/limhyesu98/limhyesu98.github.io/blob/master/CS224N%20lecture%20note.pdf).
