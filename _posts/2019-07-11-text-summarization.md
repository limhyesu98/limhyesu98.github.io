title : Text Summarization with Amazon Review Data
---

In this post, we will do automatic summarization using Amazon food reviews.





We used python and tensorflow 1.2.1. 
The model is *bi-directional RNN and LSTMs* in encoding layer and *attention mechanism* in decoding layer. It is similar to 
*sequence-to-sequence model* used in [Textsum](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/textsum).<br><br>

You can see the detail [code](https://github.com/limhyesu98/study_AutomaticSummarization/blob/master/Text_Summarization_with_Amazon_Reviews-version2.ipynb)
and [report](https://github.com/limhyesu98/study_AutomaticSummarization/blob/master/Doc_Text_Summarization_with_Amazon_Review_Data.pdf).

The code ipynb file is written in Korean and the report is written in English.
